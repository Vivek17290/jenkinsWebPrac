MAVEN WEB PROJECT AUTOMATION STEPS

Project Structure:
MavenWeb_Build → MavenWeb_Test → MavenWeb_Deploy

STEP 1: Create MavenWeb_Build Job
- Job Type: Freestyle Project
- Description: "Web Build demo"
- Source Code Management: Git
  - Repository URL: [GitMavenWeb repo URL]
  - Branches: */main or */master
- Build Steps:
  1. Invoke top-level Maven targets
     - Maven version: MAVEN_HOME
     - Goals: clean
  2. Invoke top-level Maven targets
     - Maven version: MAVEN_HOME
     - Goals: install
- Post-build Actions:
  1. Archive the artifacts: **/*
  2. Build other projects: MavenWeb_Test
     - Trigger: Only if build is stable

STEP 2: Create MavenWeb_Test Job
- Job Type: Freestyle Project
- Description: "Test demo"
- Build Environment: Delete workspace before build starts
- Build Steps:
  1. Copy artifacts from another project
     - Project: MavenWeb_Build
     - Build: Stable build only
     - Artifacts: **/*
  2. Invoke top-level Maven targets
     - Maven version: MAVEN_HOME
     - Goals: test
- Post-build Actions:
  1. Archive the artifacts: **/*
  2. Build other projects: MavenWeb_Deploy

STEP 3: Create MavenWeb_Deploy Job
- Job Type: Freestyle Project
- Description: "Web Code Deployment"
- Build Environment: Delete workspace before build starts
- Build Steps:
  1. Copy artifacts from another project
     - Project: MavenWeb_Test
     - Build: Stable build only
     - Artifacts: **/*
- Post-build Actions:
  - Deploy WAR/EAR to a container
    - WAR/EAR File: **/*.war
    - Context path: Webpath
    - Container: Tomcat 9.x remote
    - Credentials: username: admin, password: 1234
    - Tomcat URL: https://localhost:8085/

STEP 4: Create Pipeline View
- View Type: Build pipeline view
- Name: MavenWeb_Pipeline
- Layout: Based on upstream/downstream relationship
- Initial job: MavenWeb_Build

STEP 5: Run Pipeline
- Click "RUN" trigger
- Check console output for success
- Verify deployment on Tomcat at /webpath
